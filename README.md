## Game Story

BattleShip Blitz is a classic naval warfare game where you command a fleet of ships and engage in strategic battles against an AI opponent. Your mission is to locate and sink the enemy's fleet before they sink yours. Use your tactical skills to outsmart the AI and claim victory on the high seas.

## Key Points

- **Game Setup**: Place your ships on the board strategically to avoid detection by the enemy. You can drag and drop ships to position them and use the flip button to change their orientation.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: The game alternates turns between you and the AI. On your turn, click on the enemy's board to launch an attack. The AI will do the same on its turn.
- **Hit and Miss**: When you hit an enemy ship, the cell will turn red, and a hit sound will play. If you miss, the cell will turn blue, and a miss sound will play.
- **Pause and Resume**: You can pause the game at any time by clicking the pause button. A pause menu will appear, allowing you to resume the game when ready.
- **Sound Control**: Use the sound button to toggle game sounds on and off. When muted, a red diagonal line will appear on the button.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when all ships of one side are sunk. An alert will display the winner, and the game will reset.
